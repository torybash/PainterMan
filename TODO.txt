TODO:

Graphics:

-Gradually trying paint (like previously). Currently the paint is either try or wet. 

Level Editor:

Nice to have - Would it be possible that if you click on a tile it applies the properties of the tile to the level editor? For example if I select a red tile with a paint bucket the level editor automatically adjusts to the settings of the tile and I wonâ€™t have to select the red paint bucket from the drop-down menu. 
Maybe the feature could be toggled on and off.
